<p>I think a CTO should be responsible for the technical capability of the organization for creating technology that brings values to the company and executing products / projects efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>In a 1-person engineering team, this may mean ensuring the CTO oneself has the necessary skills, knowledge, experience, learning capacity, and personal management skills to execute a product / project successfully by oneself.</p>
<p>In a 5-person engineering team, this may mean managing and nurturing the team in technical skills and delegating some execution responsibility while still taking care of developing the critical parts of the system, while doing other functions like recruiting and maintaining the infrastructure.</p>
<p>In a 20-person engineering team, this may mean delegating further to the team, starting to grow new leaders within the team, while maybe still taking care of the most critical parts of the system (or training people for knowledge backups), while doing mostly recruiting, managing, mentoring, and communicating with stakeholders from other departments.</p>
<p>In a 1000-person engineering team, this may mean mostly setting the technological vision and strategy for the organization, defining and building the organizational processes and culture (quality control, knowledge sharing, onboarding, career stages, etc.), directing and hiring for your architecture board and infrastructure team and scientists, and to set goals and expectations for your tens of middle managers, while doing no coding at all except for prototyping new visionary products or technology at hackathons once in a while.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the person does it, the primarily responsibility doesn&#39;t really change.  If the organization as a whole has the horsepower and technical capability to provide values to the company with sufficient resilience during major organization-changing events, the CTO does the job well.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I myself is still learning through observing how engineering managers and more mature CTOs work and through my limited experience leading a small team.</p>

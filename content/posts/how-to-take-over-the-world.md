Been listening closely to the podcast series ["How to take over the world"](https://www.httotw.com/), just wanna make some note to self on common traits amongst great men:

1. Abundance of energy - they were prolific, and get many things done, sometimes in parallel and in different fields.
2. Focus - this manifests in the ability to compartmentalise. Also shows up as light eating habits, supposedly because of their focus on their mission.
3. Great communicators - 1 of the most powerful leverages in history is talent, and communication is the key skill. Shows up more for leaders and generals. They understand how to tap on emotions and human nature. They can motivate.
4. Long-term thinkers - many of them don't begin to succeed until at least 40. Success takes time, and they are patient about it. They always defer gratification.

**Message for today**: Now not how

Still feeling like I could have woken up earlier. Stayed up late last night to finish my work. A lot of time was spent reading and researching, perhaps a bit too much. Need to clarify exactly what I am trying to achieve, and then condition myself to just get down to the thumbtacks. Say no to every lesser tasks.

8:17am - woke up feeling well rested. Not sure if the mouth tape helped

9:43am - took a call with a candidate, got rejected for another role; still stings after so many years

12:23pm - showered, browsed a few Twitter threads, sat for 1 hour, went through morning routine, planned for the rest of the day

1:44pm - 2 pomodori to score and review candidates

2:01pm - caught up on Slack

3:04pm - finished meeting with Sandy and Vinsen about marketing tech team, signed some documents

3:38pm - finished lunch while listening to Hatching Twitter. Turns out it was a managerial mess in the beginning.

5:25pm - attended product OKR check-ins. Finished reading a few tweets and profile of Jack Dorsey

5:47pm - took a break at the verandah

7:52pm - left feedback for Shubham's 1-1, went cycling. Couldn't clock 1 hour, to resume after meeting with Ryan

8:28pm - completed call with Ryan for accountability check-in. Great session where we covered a lot of grounds. Ryan is a great listener. Followed up on Slack and closed loose threads. Next week with Ryan is planned out nicely, just have to ensure I wake up early. Time to prepare for it now by sleeping before 11pm tonight.

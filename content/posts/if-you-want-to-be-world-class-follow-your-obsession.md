title: "If you want to be world-class, follow your obsession"

I had a chat with a mentor of mine. Recently, I'd not always been feeling a consistent draw towards my role. Partially because I'd previously been drawn by the camaraderie of my team, but I get less of that with a remote work setup.

Many times, I rose to the ocassion to do what the company needed.

What this mentor enlightened me on is that you can and should follow your obsession. You'd then spend more time on it and become world-class.

Everything else, you can hire and delegate past a certain scale.

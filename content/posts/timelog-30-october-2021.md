**Message to self:**

Ship things, get things done. The ability to execute and deliver outcomes is what all great entrepreneurs are great at. The rest are details. We bicker over process because we aren't great at execution.

This comes down to rigorous planning, focussed time, GTD, motivating the team and holding them accountable.

**Learning:**

To get good at execution, focus on the 4 disciplines of execution. First is focus on the wildly important goals, second is act on the lead measures, third is keep a compelling scorecard and fourth, create a cadence of accountability. The OKRs for this quarter are the lead measures and is the scorecard.

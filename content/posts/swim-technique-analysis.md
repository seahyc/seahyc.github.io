"One minute of video analysis beats 10 years of blind training."

I have always been a book reader and solo trainer, past the point of optimality. I decided to take a leaf from my old pole-vault coach, and analyze my swim technique via video. That plus getting in a lot of actual reps of the real thing I'm doing (principle of specificity) is the correction for my personality.

Comparing against the perfect freestyle technique:

Few areas of improvement:

1. Steeper and cleaner hand entry, rather than the water slapping I do now.
2. A smaller head turn during breaths, keep half the google underwater.
3. Longer glides
4. Smaller, more frequent kicks

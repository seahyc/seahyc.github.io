**Message to self:**

Fell off the bandwagon yesterday after feeling tired in the morning, and then taking an afternoon nap along with a heavier than usual lunch. I think the guilt and fear of falling off my schedule tripped me, and sucked me into the vortex. That's fine, relapse is part of recovery, I am back on track today.

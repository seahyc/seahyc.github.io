**Message to self:**

It had been a pretty chill weekend, it was like my psychology revolted against the strict schedules and austere practices of the week, and screamed, "I need a break!". That is fine. In fact, it's needed. I just need to get back and stretch my focus muscles a little more this week. This is how progress is made. Getting back on the horse and going a little further each time.

On the other hand, my angel is having the time of her life with her new baby chickens, which makes me happy. :D

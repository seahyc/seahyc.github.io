I have heard about the Chilipad on The Tim Ferriss' Show and learnt about the importance of lowering our body temperature for sleep on "Why We Sleep". So I ordered in a Sleep Dock Pro (the latest chilipad) to test its effect on my sleep.

Turns out the Principle of Individualization applies here. I had always been more sensitive to the cold, even in the Singapore weather, and therefore could barely sleep with even a 25 degrees Celsius on the bedsheet. That, plus the hardness of the sheet, really impacted my sleep quality. I tried it for close to a week to remove any adaptation stress, but it didn't get any better. The night when I stopped using it, my sleep immediately improved.

I've since returned the system. 1 more lesson learnt about a crucial aspect of my life.

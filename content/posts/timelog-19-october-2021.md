**Message to self:**

Fasted, slept relatively early, woke up early, felt tremendous. I think I had a self-sabotaging frame that this was unsustainable before, that this wasn't ecological (i.e. fit in with the rest of my environment), but I changed that narrative to me improving every time I try it. With every day, the habit grooves are deepened. I feel clean, run clean, am productive. The other failure mode to avoid is overoptimising, and letting my perfectionist tendencies creep in. Focus on the important things. Focus on details that matter. Minimise consumption without contemplation or record. Say no to fast-twitch messaging.

3:20am - woke up

4:30am - meditated for 1 hour

6:36am - cycled for nearly an hour, finished Hatching Twitter. What a mess. Showered. Doing morning rituals now

9:59am - completed bootcamp. Had 2 bouts of diarrhea due to fasting. Napped for 10 minutes.

11:31am - finished product leadership team meeting

12:22pm - had a healthful, whole-food, plant-based lunch from my angel

7:33pm - engineering leadership meeting, 1-1 with Oswald, dead beat

**Reflections**

Need to pull organisation forward instead of reacting. Voice out issues more actively. Don't sacrifice my personal interests when crafting my role. Tap on it.

Other than that, fasting still going well, I'm going to get that paperclip over today. The high is starting to wear off, but I'm sure my mood will adjust and nornalise.

Sometimes, you wait for the meaning of things that happen in your life. You wonder why this person is in your life, or why this thing happened to you.

And before you know it, it's gone. And there was no deeper meaning to be found.

Such is life. Things come and go. And the only meaning to be had is those that we invest in them.

So stop waiting for meaning to be found. Decide the meaning for yourself.

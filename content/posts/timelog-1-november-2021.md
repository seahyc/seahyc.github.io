**Morning thoughts**

It's already the 2nd last month of the year! The weeks are long but the years are short. Time truly flies by when you're not present. Be on top of details, that gives you confidence. Hold your team to a higher standard - they are capable of that, and it levels them up too. Action is the bottleneck between knowledge and results, so overwhelm that bottleneck. Calculate odds and probability with system 2 thinking, and when the rewards:risk ratios are asymmetrically in your favour, take a few concentrated bets.

**How I want to show up today**

Courageous, joyful, driven. I am here to face down my fear, take massive action against my biggest goals, and achieve results with my team.

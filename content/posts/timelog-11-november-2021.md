Listened to MFM, a short anecdote reminded me of the importance of a clear goal and massive action-taking. Reminded because this is the main message I took from Think and Grow Rich and Tony Robbins, but they have always left me feeling high on anxiety, some bravado but short on specifics. That said, I think I overreacted by being very deliberative, overplanning, and over-researching. The best entrepreneurs do both.

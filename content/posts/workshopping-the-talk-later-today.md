I'm doing a tech sharing later today, and have been slowly converging on a topic of interest, but now is the time to draw the lines in the sand and nail down the logical structure. Specifically...

1. What are tools for thought

* Dogma: what we accept without question
* Tools for thought: language, numerals, graphs
* Our r/s with such tools: not just for dumping and expressing our thoughts, but also for developing our thoughts. Similarly, they also constrain our thoughts.

eg. words on a text file

2. Have tools for thought evolved

* Dogma: IT has progressed, Moore's Law is evidence of it
* But has it?
* Mother of All Demo/ Sketchpad
* Bicycle for the mind
* But look at most popular apps and websites
* And the affordance of the iPad
* Alan Kay - what did he say
* Evolution optimises for replication and longevity of the species, and satisfices on everything else, including quality of ideas and quality of life for the individual
* The 4 predictions/ most fertile period was the 60's and 70's because nobody knew anything, and they know that
* The 3 dimensions of thought, how we are constrained

3. How creators can and are creating better tools for thought

* Memory
* Direct manipulation of data and time
* Linked notes
* Economics jupyter notebook
* Interactive papers
* Augmenting human intelligence with AI

4. Thoughts for users of such tools

* Our value as knowledge workers originate from the quality of our thoughts
* Be aware of how our tools of thought enable as well as constrain us
* Question dogma, jump out of the box, leverage tools to see better

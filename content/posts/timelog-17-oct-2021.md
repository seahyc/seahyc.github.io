**Message to self:**

Reading Cedric's blogpost on business expertise raised more questions than it addressed. In any case, it is gratifying that business skills are learnable because there are repeatable patterns. The crux is to keep practising and failing.

**Objective for bootcamp:**

* Learn the primitives of the API
* Understand the full process, and metrics for assessments

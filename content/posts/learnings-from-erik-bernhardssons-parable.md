* Watch for a culture of output vs outcomes (eg. PM psyched about delivering 2 days in advance, but not sure about the statistical significance of the uplift)
* Get an accurate view of what is happening here
* Work with the people you have first, assess their current skillset
* Have a plan for solving both urgent and long-term problems
* Culture change starts with education
* Centralise reporting structure, decentralise work management (in other words, a matrix org)

Differentiate your services to different layers of the org

* If AI projects are stalling because "executive support went away", it is usually because you have not been demonstrating enough value

**Message to self:** Get back on track

**Trident for today:**

1. Write 1 more blog article
2. Lead product leadership meeting
3. Confirm Glints Feed hiring plan

**Morning thoughts:**

Been feeling a bit of a wanderlust, but at its core, it's me running away from taking action on my most important work. That guilt builds up and my mind very sneakily finds ways to circumvent that through "important and worthwhile" directions, like travelling, or buying things, or changing professions. Today is the day to get back to my habits. I am human optimisation. h/t to Rob Drydrek.

**Reflections**

Wound up the day doing research on iPhone cases and eventually settled on a minimalistic flex design by iPhone Rebel. While it took longer than I expected, I'm glad I found this company. The founder ran a YouTube channel where he runs actual drop tests of the iPhones with different case. That in-your-face evidence, plus his relatable story of building a simple and great product, sold me on his phone case. I am happy that I did not jump into a rash decision, but I did definitely do it over some of my more challenging and painful tasks.

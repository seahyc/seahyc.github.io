1. Things happen through me and by me, never to me.

2. All phenomenon and sensations are impermanent, non-self and suffering. Everything happens due to the presence of causal conditions.

3. I selflessly serve humanity with what it needs the most. I consistently show up and deliver. I plan in decades.

4. I learn, decide and execute smoothly. I focus on one thing at a time. I start tasks easily and persist till completion. I do the highest-impact tasks first.

5. I lead and serve people with decisiveness, compassion and clarity. I inspire the highest standards from myself and the people around me. I radiate energy and joy.

6. Every day, I march towards my death. The present is all there is.

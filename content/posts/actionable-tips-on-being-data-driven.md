* Apply XmR charts for established processes to detect variations that indicate that the probability distribution has changed (i.e. a new factor is influencing the process)

* Everything in a business is a process
* On which numbers to instrument, it should be based on the growth loops + imagine looking over your happiest customer's shoulders, track everything that would give them a great experience
* The most valuable part of the process is not the accuracy of the analysis but the actions taken based on the insights to improve key numbers
* Difference between novices and experts in this regard is that experts are disciplined enough to run an execution loop to completion without getting distracted

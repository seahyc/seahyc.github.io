**Messsage to self:**

* Face up to my painful tasks. Get clear on what is primary and what is secondary. Formatting, exploring the full extent of your tools, hobbies, replying to Slack messages - these are all secondary to the real value creation of deep focussed work. I already know what to do, so just do it.

**Trident for the day:**

1. Consolidate feedback for data science roadmap: Crux is to shape it into something the team can credibly execute on , is ecologically aligned with the engineering and product roadmap, and generates maximum imp act on the business.
2. Plan out engineering management roadmap
3. Review technical assessments of mobile engineers

**4 Pillars of Great Planning:**

1. Measurable
2. Specific
3. Accountability
4. Deadlines

Or we can go with the good ol' SMART:

**S**pecific

**M**easurable

**A**ssignable

**R**ealistic

**T**imebound

Same thing.

**Reflection**

When faced with a big ambiguous task, first do a brain dump, the specifics might guide me to the general. Also clarify the objective. Then do some research to get a feel for more specifics, and canvass a diversity of opinions. Finally scope down the work, and commit just to a rough first draft.

A day's worth of food

Recently been springkling 1 Tbsp of 100% dark chocolate to dish  
(All organic)  
  
  
**Super Veggie Preparation instructions**

* Weigh vegetables. Place broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms (maitake or shiitake), ginger and garlic in boiling water\*. Boil until tender (7-9 min). Steaming is also acceptable.
* You can choose to blend or keep whole pieces.
* Blend in a high-speed blender place 1 Tbsp of dried cumin, 1 Tbsp of apple cider vinegar, 1 fresh Lime, cooked black lentils, the strained cooked vegetables, and blend until it becomes thick soup. Can also serve as the picture above.
* If needed add some of the vegetable water (or steaming water) to thin out the texture.
* Top with hemp seeds.

Prepared correctly, taste should be an easy and smooth tasting veggie hummus. No smell/taste of garlic.  
  
I season it with [NuSalt](https://www.amazon.com/Nu-Salt-Substitute-Shaker-Ounce-Pack/dp/B07MVJTL81/) (potassium chloride).   
  
  
\*Cooked via high temperature, high humidity, high acidity, high antioxidant cooking methods to minimize formation of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) and Advanced Lipid Peroxidation End-products (ALEs).  
  
  
**A note on Super Veggie taste. The food I eat is delicious to me; one of the most exciting moments of my day. Both my teenage boys, mother, father, and brother eat the same foods daily and they love them too. When starting, sometimes there is a period of adaptation and some want to play with the recipe and texture.**

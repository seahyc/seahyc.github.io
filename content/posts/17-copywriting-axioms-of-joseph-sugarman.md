## Axioms

**Axiom 1**: Copywriting is a mental process the successful execution of which reflects the sum total of all your experiences, your specific knowledge and your ability to mentally process that information and transfer it onto a sheet of paper for the purpose of selling a product or service.

**Axiom 2:** All the elements in an advertisement are primarily designed to do one thing and one thing only; get you to read the first sentence of the copy.

**Axiom 3:** The sole purpose of the first sentence is to get you to read the second sentence.

**Axiom 4:** Your ad layout and the first few paragraphs of your ad must create the buying environment most conducive to the sale of your product or service.

**Axiom 5:** Get the reader to say "yes" and harmonise with your accurate and truthful statements while reading your copy

**Axiom 6:** Your readers should be so compelled to read our copy that they cannot stop reading until they read all of it as if sliding down a slippery slope.

**Axiom 7:** When trying to solve problems, don't assume constraints that aren't really there.

**Axiom 8:** Keep the copy interesting and the reader interested through the power of curiosity.

**Axiom 9:** Never sell a product or service. Always sell a concept.

**Axiom 10:** The incubation process is the power of your subconscious mind to use all your knowledge and experiences to solve a specific problem and its efficiency is dictated by time, creative orientation, environment and ego.

**Axiom 11:** Copy should be long enough to cause the reader to take the action you request.

**Axiom 12:** Every communication should be a personal one, from the writer to the recipient, regardless of the medium used.

**Axiom 13:** The ideas presented in your copy should flow in a logical fashion, anticipating your prospect's questions and answering them as if the questions were asked face-to-face.

**Axiom 14:** In the editing process, you refine your copy to express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words.

**Axiom 15:** Selling a cure is a lot easier than selling a preventive, unless the preventive is perceived as a cure or the curative aspects of the preventive are emphasized.

## Emotion Principles

**Emotion Principle 1:** Every word has an emotion associated with it and tells a story.

**Emotion Principle 2:** Every good ad is an emotional outpouring of words, feelings, and impressions.

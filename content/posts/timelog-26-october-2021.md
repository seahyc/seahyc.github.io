**Message to self:**

Constantly evaluate what the highest order bit is. Was a bit unsettled by some mimetic comparisons. Told Oswald about the Peter Thiel anecdote.

Of course, consistent hard work, and good judgement paves the way for these high-impact moments. But my sense is that these high-impact moments of decisions and meeting the right people, and taking a wild swing don't come about just because you work hard. You need an explicit strategy to engineer such moments.

I once heard a psychologist talk about the 10 big decisions people make which dramatically and irreversibly alter the path of their lives. Who to marry is one, where to live is another, and what to work as is yet another. The upshot from the interview is that the common big decisions are very obvious, and you should always take your time, engage your System 2 thinking to consider them carefully.

What are these high-impact decisions for me? How can I engineer more of such high-impact moments? The most relevant right now is deciding where to live, and consequently, which ecosystem to plug into. The next on that list is what to work on. The rest is basically noise.

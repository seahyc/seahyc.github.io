I'm YC. I build AI agent systems and lead ML at [Glints](https://glints.com), Southeast Asia's largest job platform with 15.5M users.

I cofounded Glints in 2013 as the youngest team to raise institutional venture capital in Southeast Asia at the time. Over the next decade, I built the engineering organization from zero to 30, raised $80M across Series A-D at a $200M valuation, and grew the platform from nothing to millions of users - relocating to Indonesia for three years to find product-market fit.

After recruiting a successor CTO, I transitioned to ML and data, where I now lead fraud detection (89% reduction in fraudulent activity), recommendation systems (collaborative filtering + TF-IDF across 16M monthly applications), and LLM-powered data pipelines.

Outside of work, I build AI tools: browser automation agents, voice-guided apps with tool use, spreadsheet AI with prompt cache optimization, and MCP servers for production databases.

I studied Computer Science and Economics (Wharton) at the University of Pennsylvania.

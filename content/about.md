I'm YC. I cofounded [Glints](https://glints.com) in 2013 - at the time, the youngest team to raise institutional VC in Southeast Asia. Over the next decade I wore most of the hats: built the engineering org from zero to 30, raised $80M across Series A-D at a $200M valuation, led our Indonesia expansion (relocated for three years to find PMF), and ran a cross-functional team of 15 to launch Vietnam.

After recruiting a successor CTO, I moved into ML and data. I now work on fraud detection (reduced fraudulent connections from 25% to under 4%), ML models for job categorization and skills inference across 16M monthly applications, and LLM-powered data pipelines - all on a platform serving 15.5M users.

I also build AI products on nights and weekends: a voice-guided cooking app that won the n8n Track Prize at the ElevenLabs Hackathon, a browser automation agent, a spreadsheet AI agent, living Harry Potter portraits, a voice-first multi-agent command center, and MCP servers for production databases. I like going from idea to working product quickly.
